title: Msiexec Remote MSI
description: Detect execution of remote msi files by msiexec.exe. The second 
  half of the query aims to detect processes spawned by msi files instead of dll files
  in the CommandLine (as that is very noisy) and may return a bit of noise within
  for the CrossProcess Object as some auto-update processes may be collected by this query.
